                    <p>
                        In 2021 March, I partook in the Nation Wide annual service event where college students and volunteers, come together to give back to the community. 
                        I was part of the team from Texas A&M Galveston that went out to an elementary school, in Galveston county, to help build park benches and maintain the school playground.
                         This opportunity was a great character-building experience, leading a team of 10 students that has the drive to serve the community. 
                        Along with the volunteering part, we also got to get on a ferry that took us across the island.

                        The Engineers Without Borders(EWB)  Dominican Republic project aims to serve underprivileged communities in the Dominican Republic. 
                        Through the implementation of water distribution and sanitation system, we plan on making a life-changing impact on the future community.
                         During the duration of the semester and henceforth, I will be working as a sub-team lead, leading the team through the medium-scale implementations we will be foreseeing next summer.
                        This project reaches me personally as someone that has had to deal with similar situations in my native land. I strongly believe that a properly functioning sanitation system and access to clean water are something that no child should need to worry about. 
                        Through this project, I aim to do my part with the resources I am privileged to have.

                    <p>
                        Project 365 by Chi Psi Beta is the Philanthropy of the fraternity I am part of. The goal of Project 365 is to raise mental health awareness and shed some light on a serious problem that is often times overshadowed.
                         This event supports the cause through Charity Dinners and Silent Walks. The Silent Walk is a half-day event where brothers walk around campus in silence to show our support. 
                        And the Charity Dinner/ Date Auction is an event where supporters can bid on a date to contribute to our philanthropy. 
                        This cause is very deeply embedded into the core value of Chi Psi Beta because we lost a fellow brother to a mental health-related disease.
